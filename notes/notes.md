*** Intro ***

Welcome, one and all!  Whether you're just browsing as a possible future vegan, or you're the self admitted militant Vegan, I'm hoping I can bring something of value to your day!  

The purpose of this little corner of the WWW is to create a network and family of Vegan's and those that maybe want to be one day.  In my normal everyday life I rarely see or speak to a vegan so having a community to feel a part of is my mission statement.

This place is a no judgement zone, I will not guilt anyone into veganism, but rather offer information and let YOU decide what fits your life.

I want to empower the use of the word 'Vegan' again, over the last few years it has been getting a bad rap and replacement words like 'plant based' have unnecessarily become more common.  There is no need for a plethora of words to describe what I am.

If you have any questions, ideas, or just want to touch base feel free to drop a message!

Vaughan the Vegan :)
